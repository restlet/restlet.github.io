In version 2.0, the Restlet engine creates its own classloader, instance
of the EngineClassLoader class. This is fine most of the time, except
when a security manager is used, such as for Applets running inside a
sandbox.

The solution is to use a custom Restlet engine as below, that won't
create this new classloader:

{{< highlight java "style=emacs" >}}public class AppletEngine extends Engine {

    @Override
    protected ClassLoader createClassLoader() {
        return getClass().getClassLoader();
    }

}
{{< /highlight >}}

Now you just need to call this line before using the Restlet API:

{{< highlight java "style=emacs" >}}Engine.setInstance(new AppletEngine());
{{< /highlight >}}

Having set up your server resource with annotated methods, you're ready
to send it requests and eager to get JSON, XML representations of its
state. But unfortunately, it fails. In some cases, you're returned an
error response with a [HTTP 405 status
code.](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.6)By
definition, it means that the sent method is not supported which keep
you quite disappointed as the resource does declare a "@Get" method!

The solution is all about content negotiation. Let's say your client
requires a JSON representation. Before the resource is sollicitated to
generate the desired representation, the content negotiation algorithm
will detect if the resource is really able to generate a JSON
representation, that is to say there is a Java method in the code of the
server resource which is (A/) properly annotated, and (B/) having a
compatible return type. the case (A/) is easy to understand, let's focus
on case (B/). This may happen when you server resource use annotation
with media type parameters:

{{< highlight java "style=emacs" >}}public class MyResource extends ServerResource {
   @Get("html")
   public String toHtml() {
      return "<html><body>hello, world</body></html>";
   }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

In this case, the client requires a JSON representation but the server
resource is not able to generate it.

This may also happen when you rely on the [converter
service](../core/services/converter),
and that you don't have properly configured the classpath of your
project. Did you reference the archive of the right Restlet extension
(such as the Jackson extension) and the archives of its library
dependencies?

The simplest way is to set the log level of the underlying Engine:

{{< highlight java "style=emacs" >}}Engine.setLogLevel(Level.FINE);

There is only a rough correspondence between the [MVC pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller) and the Restlet framework; some [debate](http://restlet-discuss.1400322.n2.nabble.com/Restlet-MVC-td1560691.html) exists as to whether it should be employed at all. For those who wish to follow the MVC pattern with Restlet, here is the basic proposition:

 * Controller == Restlets (mainly Filters, Routers, Finders). You can visualize the controller as a sort of processing chain, where the last node should be a Finder with all the information necessary to locate the target Resource for the call. Note that Finders are generally implicitely created when attaching Resource classes to a Router.
 * Model == Resource + Domain Objects. Just start from the [org.restlet.resource.Resource class](https://javadoc.io/static/org.restlet/org.restlet/{{% param version %}}/org/restlet/resource/Resource.html) and load the related Domain Objects in the constructor based on the request attributes (ex: identifier extracted from the URI). Then you can declare the available variants with getVariants() and override methods like represent(Variant) for GET, acceptRepresentation(Representation) for POST, removeRepresentations() for DELETE or storeRepresentation(Representation) for PUT.
 * View == Representation. To expose views of your model, you create new Representations for your Resources. You can leverage on one of the numerous Representation subclasses (InputRepresentation for example) available in the org.restlet.resource package or in extension packages like for JSON documents, FreeMarker and Velocity templates.
