We have already covered many aspects of the framework. Before you move
on by yourself, let's take a step back and look at two hierarchy
diagrams showing the main concepts covered in this tutorial and their
relationships:

Now, here is the hierarchy with the core Representation classes:

Beside this tutorial, your best source of information will be the
Javadocs available for the [Restlet API]({{ site.data.javadoc.preMavenCentral.baseUrl }}{{ page.version }}/jse/api/index.html),
the [Restlet Extensions]({{ site.data.javadoc.preMavenCentral.baseUrl }}{{ page.version }}/jse/ext/index.html) and the [Restlet
engine]({{ site.data.javadoc.preMavenCentral.baseUrl }}{{ page.version }}/jse/engine/index.html). Have also a look at the
[connectors](/documentation/user-guide/{{ page.version }}/core/base/connectors) section that lists
all available client and server connectors and explain how to use and
configure them, and the
[integrations](/documentation/user-guide/{{ page.version }}/extensions/editions-matrix) section for
a list of all available extensions providing pluggable features such as
integration with servlet containers, generation of dynamic
representations, etc. You can also post your questions and help others
in our [discussions forum](https://github.com/restlet/restlet-framework-java/discussions).
