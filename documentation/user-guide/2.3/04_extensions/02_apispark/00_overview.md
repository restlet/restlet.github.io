This extension provides several tools that can we used either in standalone mode within Restlet Framework or integrated with the [APISpark](https://apispark.restlet.com/) PaaS for web API for extended features.

Here are the main two features provided:

* [Introspector](/documentation/user-guide/{{ page.version }}/extensions/apispark/introspector), a tool to extract the web API definition of your Restlet API or JAX-RS API based application and push it to APISpark to provide documentation and tooling.

* [Firewall](/documentation/user-guide/{{ page.version }}/extensions/apispark/firewall), a service that adds rate limitation to your web API.
